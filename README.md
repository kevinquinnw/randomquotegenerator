# randomquotegenerator
A web application that will provide a random quots. My quotes were gathered by looking up "inspirational quotes on Reddit". 

# Instructions 
Press the button and you will be provided by a random quote, maybe inspirational, maybe it'll give you a laugh. Who cares, enjoy it. 

# How it Works
I grabbed various quotes from Reddit and used JS, CSS, and HTML to create this program. The program was made by calling to access the properties embedded inside an array. I wrote out my solution by using immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), I did this so I didn't contaminate the global variable space. HTML and CSS were the design components and the JS handled the functionality. 



I hope you enjoy!
