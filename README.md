# randomquotegenerator
Day 2 of 100 Days of Code - Random Quote Generator. I grabbed various quotes from Reddit and used JS, CSS, and HTML to create this program. The program was made by calling to access the properties embedded inside an array. 

I wrote out my solution by using immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), I did this so I didn't contaminate the global variable space. Enjoy!!
